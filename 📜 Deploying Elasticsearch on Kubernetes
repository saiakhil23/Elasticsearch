ü§î Understanding Kubernetes and Elasticsearchderstanding Kubernetes and Elasticsearch
**Before diving into the deployment process, let's quickly recap the basics of Kubernetes and Elasticsearch.**

Kubernetes Overview
Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

Elasticsearch Overview
Elasticsearch is a powerful open-source search and analytics engine designed for horizontal scalability, reliability, and real-time search. It's commonly used for log or event data analysis and full-text search.
Using Elasticsearch in conjunction with Kubernetes, allows it to reap benefits from Kubernetes' self-healing and scalability features.

üè∞ Setting Up a StatefulSet for Elasticsearch
StatefulSets are ideal for stateful applications like Elasticsearch. They provide stable, unique network identifiers and persistent storage for each pod.

Why Use StatefulSet?
Stable Network Identity: Each pod gets a unique and stable hostname.
Ordered, Graceful Deployment and Scaling: Pods are created and deleted in a predictable order.
Persistent Storage: Each pod can be associated with its storage, which persists across pod rescheduling.
